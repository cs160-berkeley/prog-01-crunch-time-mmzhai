# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Caloriculator is a calorie conversion app for Android that allows the user to enter the number of calories to convert at the top and shows the number of minutes or repitions a 150 lb person needs to perform each exercise for to burn the specified number of calories. Alternatively, the user can enter a number of minutes/repetitions for an exercise and see the number of calories it would burn, as well as the equivalent number of minutes/repetitions for all the other exercises.
